MyRO is the name we use to refer to a technique used to implement a
database privilege system on a per-record basis on the <a
href="http://www.mysql.org" target="_blank">MySQL</a> databases.
Actually all database servers implements privilege system based on
tables or columns, that is if a user has grants to access a certain
table (or a table's column) he can access all records of that table
(or that table's column). MyRO let you specify grants on a record
level so a user can access only those records it is allowed to. A
consequence of this is that different users reading the same table
will see different records. The grant mechanism provided by MyRO is
similar to that of a unix file system, that is each record belongs to
a "owner" and a "group" and has three set of permissions
associated (for the owner, the users belonging to the group and all
other users) that specify if that record can be read and/or written.
