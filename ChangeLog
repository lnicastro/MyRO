2007-11-11  Giorgio Calderone <gcalderone@ifc.inaf.it>, ver. 0.3.2-alpha1
	- First release of MYRO as a standalone package, until now it has
	been a part of the MCS project.
	
2007-01-09  Giorgio Calderone <gcalderone@ifc.inaf.it>, ver. 0.1.1
	- MyRO: the query behind the view are now simpler, thanks to the
	new features of MySQL's optimizer;

	- The "--remprotect" option of the script "myro" no longer drops
	the fields my_uid, my_gid and my_perm from the protected table,
	while the "--protect" option no longer fails when this fields
	already exists. These behaviours allows to recreate the views for
	a table without any loss of information;

	- MyRO will no longer rename a table to protect it, and the names
	of the view to access a protected table are no longer
	hardcoded. For this reason the "--protect" option named above
	requires now an extra parameter that is just the name of the views
	to be created;

	- A new option is available for MyRO: "--udf" to recreate all UDF;
	
2005-11-24  Giorgio Calderone <gcalderone@ifc.inaf.it>, ver. 0.0.7
	- The myro script now uses the DBD/DBI interface to MySQL. Look in
	the "doc" directory for instructions on how to install this
	module.

	- You can now create myro user account even if they aren't created
	as MySQL account. Myro will automatically create the necessary
	MySQL accounts.

	- When asked for the default group for a user you can simply give
	an empty string, the default group will have the same name as the
	user.

	- A new field has been added "my_usr.email". It is not used by
	MYRO, so it is user responsibility to fill it.

	- A new table will be created: "myro". It will contain information
	about myro installation, for example which version has treated the
	DB on last execution.

	- A new feature has been added: MYRO can recognize if it has been
	updated so that it will automatically modify the database
	structure to add missing fields and tables. In this case the table
	"myro" and the field "my_usr.email" will be created.

	- Some procedures had turned into functions because of perl module
	limitations: myf_loadpriv and myf_assign_usr_to_grp.

	- When the "--restore" option is given myro check that the mysql
	server is running before trying to shit it down.
	
2005-09-29  Giorgio Calderone <gcalderone@pa.iasf.cnr.it>, ver. 0.0.6
	- The myro script has two new options: --backup and --restore by
	which users can perform backup of databases and related privileges
	for future restores.

	- New procedure: myp_print_priv(usr), to get a dump of all users
	privileges.
	
2005-09-12  Giorgio Calderone <gcalderone@pa.iasf.cnr.it>, ver. 0.0.5
	- A default group with gid = 1 is created when installing myro:
	anygroup. Members of this group are automatically members of any
	group created inside myro.
